Spinning up my blog on kubernetes (GKE)


Create all of the resources
    $ kubectl apply -f .

Wait for GKE to assignn an external service IP
    $ ./watch.sh

Restore database from a backup (but I'm not tellin' where to get one)
    $ kubectl exec -i postgres -- psql -U postgres < backup.sql


TODO:
  https; Let's Encrypt probably, see https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2016/10/docker-run-glyph-rproxy.html
  db security: Not setting a password may be fine, since only containers in the same namespace can find it
  db replication: Haven't needed it so far. Authorititave data can be found on https://github.com/bencord0/blogposts/
  .well-known: This probably can be done with a few more persistent volume mounts
  dns: The service IP might be stable enough to point DNS at it
