Run a gentoo container with a shared portage tree

This assumes that you already have a NFS server which has exported /usr/portage.
Adjust the address of the NFS server to suit your needs in `nfs-pv.yml`.

Create all of the resources
  $ kubectl apply -f .

Attach to the gentoo container, and start emerging stuff.
  $ kubectl exec -it $pod -- bash
  # emerge eix
